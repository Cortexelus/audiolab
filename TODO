Things to do before a release
-----------------------------
    - better error reporting (support error logging of sndfile ?): the
      exceptions launched are pretty random...
    - add inout argument in read method to avoid recreating a buffer.
    - more tests
    - add an audio player for at least linux/windows/mac os x (0.8-0.9) -> This
      will be done in a different branch

Pending issues
--------------
    - There is no check for supported format, the way get_supported_format is
      implemented now it totally broken. Instead of using values from the
      header, should use sf_command
    - removing most warning from pylint
    - handling in audiolab when first is not 0 (now, we have seek :))

Maybe ?
-------
    - change array layout convention to numpy's ones (eg row major, not column
      major), and add an axis argument. -> this is a bit tricky, actually, as
      sndfile only supports interleaved data, where F order actually make sense. 
      Not sure what to do
    - ogg vorbis support ? libsndfile does not support ogg (yet). Maybe use the
      reference lib, but this may be a bit complicated to support both library
      at the same time.
